<p>This page describes the main NEMS mediator. There is also a NEMS space weather mediator.</p>
<p>In the NUOPC Layer architecture, the mediator (often called the coupler) handles the scientific and customized aspects of coupling for a modeling system. For example, it may handle transfer of coupling fields, regridding, merging, treatments of coastlines or custom field transformations.</p>
<p>For mediator diagrams and additional description, see the <a href="https://esgf.esrl.noaa.gov/site_media/projects/couplednems/pres_1502_NEMS_mediator.pdf">NEMS mediator overview presentation (Craig, Feb. 6 2015)</a></p>
<h2>Overview </h2>
<p>In NEMS, the mediator is a separate gridded component with multiple phases. Phases can be thought of as different subroutines within the mediator that can be called in some sequence to carry out the work of the mediator. The mediator runs on its own set of PETs (persistent execution threads, similar to processors). Often the PETs chosen for the mediator overlap with other components to optimize resource utilization. The PETs and run sequence are specified by the compset. Mediator phases might have names like prep_atm, prep_ocn, restart, accumulate, and so forth. The way the mediator phases are implemented is somewhat arbitrary and will probably evolve over time as sequencing requirements change.</p>
<h2>Mediator PE layout </h2>
<p>The mediator PETs are set in NEMS in the nems.configure file. Other mediator attributes are also defined there in a section that looks like this, </p>
<pre class="fragment">MED_model:                         nems
MED_petlist_bounds:             76 135
MED_attributes::
  Verbosity = 0
  DumpFields = true
  DumpRHs = false
  coldstart = false
  restart_interval = 0
::
</pre><h2>Components </h2>
<p>The main NEMS mediator is capable of technically coupling atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, land, hydrology, and wave components. All of these component types have demonstrated techically correct passage of fields through the mediator. Only the behavior of atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice components has been examined to assess correct physical coupling.</p>
<p>All components do not have to be present to operate the NEMS mediator.</p>
<h2>Exchange Fields </h2>
<p>The mediator and all components advertise fields during initialization. NUOPC reconciles those field names and then coupling fields are realized and connected. In order for a field to be connected between two components, it has to be advertised in the two components as well as in the mediator. Field names that match between components are automaticallly coupled in the system. Any field that is exported from one component and imported to another component with the same standard name is coupled between those components.</p>
<p>Separately, there is an ability for the mediator to customize the coupling interactions via merges or custom calculations where coupling fields are derived on the fly from each other. This is not done automatically and require implementation of the custom calculations in the mediator. Typically, these are done in the prep phases.</p>
<h2>Coupling Periods </h2>
<p>There is a slow and a fast coupling period in the NEMS mediator. The slow coupling period is associated with the ocean model and allows the ocean model to be coupled at a lower frequency than other components. The fast coupling period is for the atmosphere and ice model. They are coupled at the same frequency in the system.</p>
<h2>Accumulation and Averaging </h2>
<p>The mediator accumulates all fields between coupling periods for all components. For example, the atmosphere and ice coupling fields are accumulated and averaged between calls to the ocean model. At the same time, the ocean fields coupled to the atmosphere and ice models are held static between the longer ocean coupling periods.</p>
<h2>Grids </h2>
<p>Model grids are passed to the mediator at initialization. The mediator receives those grids and instantiates a decomposition of those grids on its PETs (persistent execution threads, similar to processors). The mediator is then able to receive all model fields on the native model grids.</p>
<p>The ocean and ice components will generally be run on the same grid for science reasons, but the mediator is implemented such that this is not a requirement.</p>
<h2>Interpolation (Regridding) </h2>
<p>Regridding is performed by the mediator. The regridding weights are computed at initialization and depend on the grids and regridding method. The regridding method is defined in the mediator on a field-by-field basis when the field is defined. In general, fluxes are mapped conservatively, and states are mapped bilinearly. The higher order finite element patch method was not used for any fields because of an observed reproducibility issue.</p>
<p>In the current revision, fields transferred from the ocean to the sea ice component are copied rather than interpolated. This can be done because the ocean and sea ice components are on the same grid. When different grids are detected for these components, the interpolation method defaults to bilinear.</p>
<h2>Run Sequence </h2>
<p>The run sequence is evolving as new requirements are defined. There are several mediator phases currently implemented in the mediator and a typical UGCS-Seasonal run sequence is set up as follows as shown in a typical nems.configure file, </p>
<pre class="fragment">runSeq::

</pre><p>In the file above, the sequence of component run calls (ie. OCN, ICE, ATM), field coupling via connectors (ie. ATM to MED), and mediator phases (ie. <code>"MedPhase_prep_ice"</code>, <code>"MedPhase_atm_ocn_flux"</code>, MedPhase_write_restart) are indicated. The coupling periods are also defined (ie. @1800.0, @900.0) for the ocean and atmosphere/ice models.</p>
<p>The current implementation of the mediator phases does the following,</p>
<p><code>MedPhase_prep_ocn</code> - prepares the ocean coupling fields for the ocean model by averaging the atm/ice coupling fields, interpolating fields to the ocean grid, computing any merges or custom field calculations, and then filling the ESMF State sent to the ocean model.</p>
<p><code>MedPhase_prep_atm</code> - prepares the atmosphere coupling fields for the atmosphere model by interpolating fields to the atmosphere grid, computing any merges or custom field calculations, and then filling the ESMF State sent to the atmosphere model.</p>
<p><code>MedPhase_prep_ice</code> - prepares the sea ice coupling fields for the sea ice model by interpolating fields to the sea ice grid, computing any merges or custom field calculations, and then filling the ESMF State sent to the sea ice model.</p>
<p><code>MedPhase_atm_ocn_flux</code> - computes the atmosphere/ocean fluxes from atmosphere and ocean fields. The computation is done on the ocean grid and data from the atmosphere model are interpolated to the ocean grid. These fluxes can be used in the atmosphere and ocean model.</p>
<p><code>MedPhase_accum_fast</code> - accumulates the atmosphere and ice coupling fields for coupling to the ocean model.</p>
<p><code>MedPhase_write_restart</code> - writes mediator restart files.</p>
<h2>Reconciliation of Masks </h2>
<p>The land mask implementation is described in more detail here.</p>
<h3>Exchange Field Sign and Direction Conventions</h3>
<p>The NEMS mediator uses the convention that heat/water/momentum flux is positive downward. There is also a hierachy of "down" with respect to models, which from top to bottom is:</p>
<ul>
<li>atm</li>
<li>lnd</li>
<li>rof</li>
<li>ice</li>
<li>ocn</li>
</ul>
<p>If a flux in the coupler is positive, that means it's transferring heat/water/momentum downward from a higher component to a lower component.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Precip will always be positive from the atm-&gt;lnd/ocn/ice</li>
<li>Downward shortwave will always be positive from the atm-&gt;lnd/ocn/ice</li>
<li>Evap will always be negative from the lnd/ocn/ice-&gt;atm, that means water is transferred from the surface models to the atmosphere.</li>
<li>Precip+runoff will always be positive from <code>"atm-&gt;lnd-&gt;rof-&gt;ocn"</code> </li>
<li>Atm/ocn fluxes are computed in the mediator and are positive into the ocean. So, the same sign of fluxes is passed to both the atm and ocean. For the ocean, positive means heat/water/momentum into the ocean and for the atm, positive means heat/water/momentum out of the atm.</li>
<li>The ice computes atm/ice stresses and ocn/ice stresses. The stresses it computes are stresses on the ice model. So to meet the convention, it has to pass out the atm/ice stress and -ocn/ice stress because the sign convention says the flux in the coupler is the stress on the ice from the atm and the stress on the ocn from the ice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Models have to adhere to this convention for fluxes that are exported. They also have to be aware of this convention for fluxes that are imported.</p>
<p>This sign convention has some problems. For instance, if the atm/ice and ocn/ice fluxes were computed OUTSIDE the ice model and passed in as a merged field, the sign convention would break down. The sign convention in NEMS can be changed in the future but a standard has to be defined. Custom Field Derivations</p>
<p>There is a section of the mediator that allows for custom coupling interactions. In general, coupling fields can be derived and set there. This can be used to derive fields from other fields or to change signs or units. Custom calculations are used to derive the downward solar to the ocean component from atmosphere shortwave and albedo fields.</p>
<h2>Flux Field Treatment </h2>
<p>The NEMS system couples heat, water, and momentum fluxes. In general, fluxes are computed at the interface between two components and those fluxes are often computed in one of the two components or in the mediator. Fluxes are normally interpolated conservatively, but the best regridding method for a particular application is a science issue.</p>
<p>The mediator is able to compute fluxes as well as regrid and couple fluxes computed in components. There is no specific constraint on how or where the fluxes should be computed. Often the choice depends on the relative coupling frequency, the amount of information required to be coupled to compute the fluxes, the sophistication of the flux calculation, the relative grid resolution, and whether an exchange grid is used.</p>
<p>In NEMS, fluxes are computed in a number of places currently. The atmosphere model currently computes the atmosphere/ocean, atmosphere/ice, and atmosphere/land fluxes. The sea ice model computes atmosphere/ice fluxes and ocean/ice fluxes. The mediator is able to compute atmosphere/ocean fluxes. Normally, it's important for the same flux to be used in the components associated with the flux interface and for the fluxes to be computed in one place, but this is not a requirement. Again, this is a science issue.</p>
<p>For some components, fluxes need to be merged. For instance, on the atmosphere grid, the ice fraction might evolve in time and the land fraction might be static. For conservation, the merging of fluxes is as important as the regridding and reuse of fluxes. Again, this is a science issue.</p>
<p>To compute fluxes,</p>
<ul>
<li>a specific flux method and implementation have to exist or be developed</li>
<li>the required coupling fields to compute the flux have to be interpolated and passed into the flux calculation</li>
<li>the computed fluxes have to be interpolated and passed to the relevant components</li>
<li>there needs to be some coordination between components and the mediator about what fields are coupled and where computations are carried out</li>
</ul>
<p>In the current implementation, the mediator interpolates the time evolving ice fraction from the sea ice model and that is sent to the atmosphere model as a coupling field. The sea ice model computes both atmosphere/ice fluxes and ice/ocean fluxes. The mediator merges the atmosphere/ocean fluxes computed in the mediator and the ice/ocean fluxes using the ice fraction and passes those fields to the ocean model. The mediator also merges the atmosphere/ice fluxes computed in the ice model and the atmosphere/ocean fluxes computed in the mediator and sends those fluxes to the atmosphere model. The atmosphere model receives the merged atmosphere/ocean and atmosphere/ice fluxes and ice fraction and then somehow merges that with the atmosphere/ocean fluxes and atmosphere/land fluxes computed within the gsm.</p>
<p>In particular, the fluxes that are computed at the interface are the latent and sensible heat flux, evaporation, momentum stress, and upward longwave flux. The atmosphere computes the downward longwave, downward shortwave, and precipitation. The albedos are also critical in the computation of the shortwave as it's the net shortwave that has to match across the flux interface. To compute these fluxes in various components, states from the atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice models such as SST, ocean currents, surface temperature and humidity, density, surface winds and others are coupled between the relevant models.</p>
<p>In the current implementation, the atmosphere/ocean flux in the mediator is computed on the ocean grid. But again, the location of these computations and the appropriate grid is a science issue. Fluxes are computed in the components on their native grid. Generally, the merges occur on the destination grid after interpolation. All coupling is explicit in the current implementation but implicit coupling may be desired in the future.</p>
<p>The atmosphere/ice and atmosphere/ocean fluxes are merged in the mediator as follows. First, we interpolate the ice fraction and fluxes onto the atmosphere grid using interpolation weights generated at initialization, </p>
<pre class="fragment">F_ice2atm_a = WM_i2a * F_ice2atm_i
F_ocn2atm_a = WM_i2a * F_ocn2atm_i
ice_fraction_a = WM_i2a * ice_fraction_i
</pre><p>Then In the mediator, the atmosphere/ice and atmosphere/ocn fluxes are merged such that: </p>
<pre class="fragment">F_iceocn2atm_a = ice_fraction_a*F_ice2atm_a + (1-ice_fraction_a)*F_ocn2atm_a
</pre><p>That flux is passed to the atmosphere model. In the atmosphere model, the land flux, ice flux, and ocn flux are then merged again, </p>
<pre class="fragment">F_atm_a = ocn_fraction_a * F_iceocn2atm_a + (1 - ocn_fraction_a) * F_lnd2atm_a
</pre><p>where ocn_fraction_a is the clipping destination fraction associated with the mapped ocean mask.</p>
<p>While this approach is efficient and simple to implement, this suffers from land-ocean masking problem when land and ocean have different resolution. One approach to resolve the masking problem is to introduce an exchange grid where the ambiguous or unclaimed intersection cells between the land and ocean grids can have exclusive ownership.</p>
<h2>Field Merging </h2>
<p>The mediator contains a generic merge method that allows multiple fields to be merged together into a destination field. The source field(s) can be weighted by fractions or other arrays. The merging method is used to convert mean_laten_heat_flux to mean_evap_rate in the atmosphere to ocean coupling. It is also used to apply fraction weighting to merge atm and/or ice fields for the ocean component for <code>mean_prec_rate</code>, <code>mean_fprec_rate</code>, <code>mean_evap_rate</code>, <code>mean_sensi_heat_flx</code>, <code>mean_laten_heat_flx</code>, <code>mean_down_lw_flx</code>, <code>mean_zonal_moment_flx</code>, and <code>mean_merid_moment_flx</code>.</p>
<p>The following are the field merge calls in the mediator: </p>
