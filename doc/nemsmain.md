NEMS Documentation
==================

This website describes the coupling infrastructure and
techniques used in the
[NOAA Environmental Modeling System (NEMS)](https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/emc/pages/infrastructure/nems.php), which forms the backbone of the Unified Forecast System (UFS).
NEMS coupling infrastructure is based on the
[Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)](http://www.earthsystemmodeling.org/)
and
[National Unified Operational Prediction Capability (NUOPC)](https://www.earthsystemmodeling.org/nuopc/)
Layer code and conventions. The software incorporates atmosphere, ocean, ice, wave and other models. The coupled system will be used for weather and longer range predictions.

Everything in this doxgen-generated webpage is created from files
within the NEMS repository.  Further information outside this website can be found in links
within the above paragraph.
