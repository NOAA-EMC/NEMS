Cap Documentation {#cap-page}
=================

Caps are codes that act as adaptors, enabling models to use 
[NUOPC](https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/nuopc/)
standard component interfaces. They are called caps because they "sit
on top" of user code and call into it. They contain translations of
native model data structures into ESMF data structures.

For documentation of caps, see the 
[Earth System Prediction Suite (ESPS)](https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/esps/)
site. Find the components on the table on the landing page, and
follow the corresponding Code Access and Documentation link. Not all
listed components have documented caps. The ESPS is a collection of
components that are compliant with NUOPC conventions.
