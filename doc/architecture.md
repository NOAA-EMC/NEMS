Architecture {#architecture}
============

The NEMS architecture is based on an ESMF component hierarchy with the
application driver `MAIN_NEMS` at the top, calling into the
`NEMS_COMP` component, which in turn drives the `EARTH_COMP`
component. The `EARTH_COMP` drives the `ATM` and other components.
The architecture allows for multiple `EARTH_COMP` instances.

NEMS includes atmosphere, ocean, ice, wave, land,
aerosol/chemistry, and hydrologic models, with coupling interface and
utilities based on the 
[Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)](https://www.earthsystemmodeling.org).
The NEMS applications also utilize intreopereability conventions
introduced by the 
[National Unified Operational Prediction Capability (NUOPC)](https://www.earthsystemmodeling.org/nuopc/).

Key architecture features are:

* Data exchanges between major model components go through a central
  (NEMS) mediator component. There
  may be additional specialized mediators (e.g. for the 3D
  interactions associated with space weather coupling).

* The NEMS mediator component is an integral part of the NEMS
  software. The mediator source code is managed alongside the NEMS
  source code and is built when the NEMS executable is built.

* Component models are treated by NEMS as external
  dependencies. Their source code is managed outside of NEMS,
  typically in the proximity of the organization maintaining the
  official version of the model. Each model maintains its own separate
  make system with a NUOPC compliant build option. NEMS requires that
  the pre-built models are available when the NEMS executable is being
  built.

* All of the components driven by they EARTH_COMP are NUOPC-compliant
  components.

* All of the components driven by they EARTH_COMP can be configured to
  run on a specific set of PETs (MPI processes), supporting concurrent
  or sequential component execution.

* Data exchanges between components are handled by generic
NUOPC_Connector components.
* The generic connectors perform basic regrid and redist operations as needed to
take field data from one side to the other.
